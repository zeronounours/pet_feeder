Pet Feeder
==========

Most online pet feeders only works for small pet biscuits. It was not my case,
so I decided to create my own for bigger biscuits (in my case about a cylinder
of 3mm radius and 25mm long).

This repository contains the openSCAD model used to create the feeder on a 3D
printer and the Arduino code to control the motor.

For the Arduino, I use:
* A **Arduino Uno**,
* With a **Rotoshield** (motor driver shield for Arduino from SnootLab).

The shield may me changed for your own purposes, with few changes on the code.
